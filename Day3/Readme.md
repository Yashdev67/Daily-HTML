>On the day 03 of Learning Web Development, I have created my very first project using only HTML
>The Bookmark Manager: Home for all my personal websites.
    >I can just open the Bookmark manager to see all my favourite websites at one place 
    >It saves my time as I don't have to type the url of each indivudal websites. 
    >I can directly click on the link and boom the website is opened.

>Things used in making of Bookmark manager:
  >I have used the basic <div>,<br> and <a> tags to make this project
  ><div>: Used to group the primary and secondary bookmarks
  > Anchor tag: Used to link the URL of the sites
  > BR tag: Used to go to new lines

>The source code of the project is added in the DAY 03 folder 😏
