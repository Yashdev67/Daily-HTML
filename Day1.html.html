#DAY 1
Today I learned about basic boilet plate of html, what is Doctype,html lang, met charset in html and why they are used, I also learned about head and body tag 
How the head and body tag are differnt from each other, Eveything inside body tag is visible in the browser but the head tag content is not

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
     <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="author" content="Yash"> 
        <meta name="description" content="This is my first webpage">
        <link rel="icon" href="html5.png" type="image/png">
        <title>
            My First Webpage
        </title>
        <style>
            html{
                font-size:20px;

            }
            body{
                background-color:black;
                color:white;
            }
        </style>
     </head>
     <body>
          <h1>
            Hello World!
          </h1>
